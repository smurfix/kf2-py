# Introduction

Kalles Fraktaler, meet Python.
Python, meet Kalles Fraktaler.

You're very welcome.

Warning: this is the development branch of a work in progress. Things may
look funky, break, crash, and/or eat your CPU for breakfast. Don't YET use
this in production. We'll get there.

# Building

Prerequisites:

    sudo apt install git build-essential devscripts
    git clone https://github.com/smurfix/clew.git
    cd clew
    debuild -b -us -uc
    cd ..
    sudo dpkg -i libclew-dev_*.deb

    git clone https://github.com/smurfix/kf2
    cd kf2
    sudo apt install $(igrep -v '#' REQUIREMENTS)
    make embed -j$(nproc)

    sudo ln -s $(pwd)/libkf2-embed.so /usr/local/lib/
    sudo ldconfig

    git clone https://github.com/smurfix/kf2-py.git python
    cd python
    sudo apt install $(igrep -v '#' REQUIREMENTS)
    make

You can build the regular KF2 `.exe` along with the embedded library. Just
run "make clean" in between. KF2's Makefile is hand-written and doesn't
support separate object directories; sorry about that.

# Running

    cd kf2/python # if you're not there anyway

    ./KF

All options of the Windows KF2 are accepted. They probably won't do
anything sensible yet, but that's a different problem. :-P

# Status

I want to establish feature parity with the Windows binary â€“ with a nice
GTK front-end, and programmability in Python.

We're not there yet.

Help with re-implementing all those dialogs, menus and whatnots is gladly
accepted. Please co-ordinate via https://github.com/smurfix/kf2-py/discussions
as we don't want three people to work on Newton-Raphson zooming while
nobody thinks about the Color dialog.

## TODOs

- autoload/save default settings
- fix window title
- implement target and viewport scaling
- implement zoom and pan
- implement all those menus
- implement load+save from the UI
- implement all those dialogs
- implement all those options
- test OpenCL
- test OpenGL
- implement Mapping-based storage for settings and params

# Future Work

Fix panning: copy data instead of recalculating the world.

Write an efficient framework for movies that do more than zoom in or out.

Think about an async batch workflow (anyio).

The ability to write the Fractal equation in Python (gmpy2 and/or numpy) would be a very nice addition.
